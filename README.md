# Landlubber Compass

## Project Idea
The landlubber compass is a treasure map to a sea-creature loving, swashbuckling, no-nonsense having pirate!

### Usage
Once you search for your specimen, the app present a sleek picture and some info on the creature that you can show off to your homies... I mean crewmates.

### Limits
What I initially wanted was a full fish database that would show you the fish's natural habitat but then I realized a bit too late that fish and pretty much all animals don't live in just one location. Its a range, so I pivoted into a local aquarium search engine. I couldn't get it to jive nicely with radar.io but I think I'll finish this one.
